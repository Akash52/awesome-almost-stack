Some common features of Angular include:

- Two-way data binding: allows changes in the model to automatically update the view, and vice versa.
- Directives: allow for the manipulation and creation of custom HTML elements and attributes.
- Components: modular units of an Angular application that can be reused across the application.
- Services: provide a way to share data and functionality across different components.
- Dependency injection: a way to inject services and other objects into components, making them more modular and easier to test.
- Routing: allows for the creation of different views and navigation within the application.
- Templates: used to define the layout and structure of a component's view.
- Forms: allows for the creation and validation of forms within the application.
- Pipes: used to transform data for display in the template.
- TypeScript: Angular is written in TypeScript and uses its features such as classes, interfaces and decorators.
