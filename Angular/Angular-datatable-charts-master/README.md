# Website-Sessions-Dashboard-Angular
The sample demonstrates how you can use Wijmo's FlexMap, FlexGrid, FlexPie, and FlexChart controls in conjunction with GeoJSON data to create an interactive dashboard to display website traffic statistics. Users can hover over nations to get a small breakdown of statistical averages for each country based on the average server response time, number of page views, and issues reported. Clicking on a country will give a breakdown of users based on the platform and browser they're using, as well as session duration. The dashboard also uses FlexChart to display global session information, broken down between browsers and platforms used between the current and previous month.
